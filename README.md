# 🎛️ FloatCraft: IEEE Floating Point Arithmetic Unit

**FloatCraft** is a Verilog-based solution designed to handle floating-point arithmetic. It focuses on the conversion of decimal numbers to IEEE754 floating-point format and the arithmetic operations of these numbers.

## 🎯 Aim:
To convert a given decimal number to IEEE single precision floating point number format and use this conversion to do floating point addition and substraction, ensuring the output is in IEEE floating point format.

## 🛠️ Use Cases:
- **🔊 Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)**: For high-precision signal processing tasks.
- **🖥️ Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)**: Useful in scientific computing or graphics rendering.
- **🔌 Embedded Systems**: Achieving desired accuracy and performance in control systems or sensor data processing.
- **🎓 Educational Purposes**: A tool for teaching IEEE754 standard and Verilog programming.
- **🔧 Custom Hardware Accelerators**: Designing high-speed floating-point arithmetic on FPGAs.

## ✅ Verification:
The floating point representations of the two inputs are Number1 and Number2, respectively. The result is the output obtained after performing the addition operation. For cross-verification of the floating point representations, you can use the [Floating Point Converter](https://www.exploringbinary.com/floating-point-converter/).
